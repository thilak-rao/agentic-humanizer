# Agentic Humanizer for Claude, Codex, Hermes Agent, and OpenClaw

Agentic Humanizer rewrites AI-generated text with a full 5-pass workflow,
saved preferences, and optional stylometric voice matching. It is built for
Claude, Codex, Hermes Agent, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and other
AI coding or writing agents.

**Core functionality does not require Slop or Not.** Without Slop or Not, the
skill still interviews for preferences, can match a writing sample, runs all
five rewrite passes, and returns the final draft. Slop or Not Pro only adds the
measured local layer: AI score, Flesch-Kincaid readability, Text Cleanup before
and after humanization, and cleanup stats.

## What It Does

1. Resolves dialect, reading level, tone, and length preferences.
2. Optionally extracts a stylometric voice fingerprint from your sample.
3. Runs five rewrite strategies against common AI-writing tells and
   supplemental artifact checks.
4. Uses Slop or Not Pro for on-device AI detector scoring and Text Cleanup when available.
5. Returns humanized text, loop history, highest-impact edits, and, when
   Slop or Not Pro cleanup ran, a Text Cleanup summary.

Without Slop or Not, score and grade show as `n/a` and the skill does not
claim detector convergence. Slop or Not Pro stops when the on-device AI detector score and
readability target converge, or returns the best measured iteration after the
cap.

## Install

Install the full `slopornot` plugin bundle when your agent supports plugins.

Codex:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add numen-tech/slopornot
```

Then run `codex`, open `/plugins`, switch to the `slopornot` marketplace, and
choose `Install plugin`.

Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add numen-tech/slopornot
/plugin install slopornot@slopornot
```

Claude Code namespaces plugin skills by plugin name:

```text
/slopornot:agentic-humanizer
```

Direct skill installs and non-plugin clients invoke:

```text
/agentic-humanizer
```

## Usage

```text
/agentic-humanizer
[paste your AI-generated text here]
```

Use a voice sample for one call:

```text
/agentic-humanizer voice=/path/to/sample.txt [paste]
```

Use saved preferences without another interview:

```text
/agentic-humanizer skip-interview [paste]
```

## Inline Overrides

```text
/agentic-humanizer dialect=us grade=8 tone=casual length=±10 threshold=20 max=7 [paste]
```

Available flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `dialect=us` or `dialect=uk` | Set the English variant. |
| `grade=N` | Set the target Flesch-Kincaid grade. |
| `tone=casual`, `tone=professional`, or `tone=academic` | Set the rewrite tone. |
| `length=±10`, `length=exp`, or `length=trim` | Keep length close, allow expansion, or allow trimming. |
| `threshold=N` | Override the Slop or Not Pro AI-score target. |
| `max=N` | Override the Slop or Not Pro measured-iteration cap. |
| `voice=/path/to/file.txt` | Use a writing sample for this run. |
| `voice=off` or `voice-skip` | Skip voice matching. |
| `skip-interview` | Use saved preferences or defaults. |

## Local Files

Agentic Humanizer stores preferences and optional voice data under:

```text
~/.agentic-humanizer/
```

That directory can contain:

- `profile.json`
- `voice.txt`
- `voice-fingerprint.json`

Manage them with:

```text
/agentic-humanizer show profile
/agentic-humanizer reset
/agentic-humanizer show voice
/agentic-humanizer reset voice
/agentic-humanizer set voice=/path/to/file.txt
```

## Related Slop Or Not Tools

The broader `slopornot` plugin bundle includes local Mac tools for:

- AI text detection
- AI image detection
- readability analysis
- Text Cleanup
- raw image scoring
- Pro status checks

Use `slop-check` for one-shot local analysis. Use `agentic-humanizer` for
rewriting. Slop or Not makes the rewrite measurable, but it is not required
for the rewrite workflow or voice matching.
