# SlopOrNot Claude Code Plugin

This plugin packages SlopOrNot skills for Claude Code. SlopOrNot lets Claude,
Codex, Hermes Agent, OpenClaw, and other agents call a local AI text detector,
AI image detector, readability analyzer, and text cleanup tool on your Mac.
This release includes two skills: `agentic-humanizer` and `slop-check`.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add numen-tech/slopornot
/plugin install slopornot@slopornot
```

## Use

Claude Code namespaces plugin skills by plugin name. Run:

```text
/slopornot:agentic-humanizer
/slopornot:slop-check
```

Use `agentic-humanizer` to rewrite AI-generated text with a full 5-pass
workflow, saved preferences, and optional voice matching. It does not need
Slop or Not for core humanization. Slop or Not Pro adds on-device AI detector scoring,
Flesch-Kincaid readability, Text Cleanup before and after humanization, and a
cleanup summary. Use `slop-check` to run one-shot on-device AI text detection, AI
image detection, Flesch-Kincaid readability scoring, text cleanup, raw image
scoring, or a Pro status check.

`slop-check` needs Pro for detection, readability, cleanup, and image scoring.

and [skills/slop-check/SKILL.md](skills/slop-check/SKILL.md).
