# Harness Routing — Generic (plain-text questions)

`SKILL.md` routes here when the host harness is unrecognized OR when a
recognized harness's question tool is unavailable. Use plain-text
questions and parse the user's reply manually.

## When this file applies

- Any harness not listed in `harnesses/` (AiderDesk, future wrappers, etc.)
- A recognized harness where the question tool fails or returns an error
- A user override: invoking `/agentic-humanizer plain-text [paste]`

## The interview

Only ask Q5 when no inline or saved `voice_path` has resolved,
`~/.agentic-humanizer/voice.txt` is absent, and the saved profile does not
contain `"voice_skip": true`.

Send the user this exact message:

```text
Before I run the agentic humanization loop, I need 4 quick answers.
Reply with the four tokens in order, on one line, e.g. "1 3 b ±10".

1) Which English variant?
   1. American English
   2. British English
   3. Other (specify after your answer)

2) What reading level should the output target?
   1. Elementary (Grade 3–5)
   2. Middle school (Grade 6–8)
   3. High school (Grade 9–11)
   4. College (Grade 12–15)
   5. Graduate or professional (Grade 16+)

3) What tone?
   a. Casual
   b. Professional
   c. Academic

4) Length policy?
   ±10  Keep within ±10% of original
   exp  Allow expansion
   trim Allow trimming
```

If Q5 is eligible, send this five-answer variant instead:

```text
Before I run the agentic humanization loop, I need 5 quick answers.
Reply with the five tokens in order, on one line, e.g. "1 3 b ±10 n".

1) Which English variant?
   1. American English
   2. British English
   3. Other (specify after your answer)

2) What reading level should the output target?
   1. Elementary (Grade 3–5)
   2. Middle school (Grade 6–8)
   3. High school (Grade 9–11)
   4. College (Grade 12–15)
   5. Graduate or professional (Grade 16+)

3) What tone?
   a. Casual
   b. Professional
   c. Academic

4) Length policy?
   ±10  Keep within ±10% of original
   exp  Allow expansion
   trim Allow trimming

5) Mimic a writing sample of yours?
   y      Yes
   n      No
   never  Never ask again
```

Wait for the user's reply. Parse strictly:

- Q1: integer 1–3. If `3`, prompt once more for the dialect string.
- Q2: integer 1–5. Map to grade midpoint (4, 7, 10, 13, 17).
- Q3: letter a/b/c.
- Q4: token `±10` / `exp` / `trim`.
- Q5, when present: token `y` / `n` / `never`.

If the reply does not parse, send: *"I couldn't parse that. Please reply
with four tokens, e.g. `1 3 b ±10`."* and wait again. Maximum 2 reparse
attempts; on the third bad reply, fall back to defaults
(American · High school · Professional · ±10%) and proceed.

For the five-answer variant, change the reparse example to
`1 3 b ±10 n`.

## After the interview

Capture the four answers as variables:

- `dialect` ∈ {`us`, `uk`, `other:<string>`}
- `target_grade` ∈ {4, 7, 10, 13, 17}
- `tone` ∈ {`casual`, `professional`, `academic`}
- `length_policy` ∈ {`±10`, `exp`, `trim`}
- `voice_choice` ∈ {`yes`, `no`, `never`} when Q5 is present

When Q5 is `y`, say exactly: *"Paste 200+ words as your next message."*
Capture the next user turn as the voice sample and return to `SKILL.md`
Step 4 for validation, writing, and fingerprint extraction. The parser at
the top of this section already collected any `Other`-dialect string
before reaching this point, so the voice prompt cannot collide with it.

When Q5 is `never`, persist `voice_skip`.

Return to `SKILL.md` § Loop algorithm with these answers.

## Fingerprint approval (no gate)

The Yes / Edit / Re-extract approval gate from `SKILL.md` Step 4 needs
a structured-question tool that the generic harness does not have. When
Step 4 reaches that gate, degrade to print-and-continue:

1. Print the extracted fingerprint JSON to the user, fenced as a code
   block so the structure is readable.
2. Print this exact line: *"To re-extract or edit this fingerprint
   later, run `/agentic-humanizer reset voice` and rerun."*
3. Validate the fingerprint against
   `references/voice-fingerprint.md` § Required fields. If any required
   field is missing, set `voice_active=false`, add the
   extraction-failure footer flag for Step 7, and skip writing the
   cache. Do not try to ask the user to edit.
4. If validation passes, save the fingerprint to
   `~/.agentic-humanizer/voice-fingerprint.json`, update `profile.json`
   per `SKILL.md` Step 4's `Yes` branch, and proceed.

Do not block the loop on a question the harness cannot render cleanly.
